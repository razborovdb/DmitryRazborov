	Hi, there.
	I'm Dmitry Razborov.
	I'm a programming fan.

	For the first time, I encountered programming in the nineties of the last century. In my first job, I wrote programs on Assembler for controllers that controlled the technological process.
	Later I started interested in higher-level programming languages C++ and VisualBasic. It was in the late nineties. At this time I wrote programs for creating Databases and User Interfaces.
	At the beginning of the two thousandths, I started interested in process automation systems. I developed and implemented algorithms for process control in oil refining based on automation systems such as the DCS system DeltaV of Emerson Process Management, and Yokogawa systems.
	Now I decided to structure my knowledge in software development. Since all my knowledge was based on an independent study of the principles and methods of programming. Therefore, I decided to take the courses offered by Bloomtech, and then I wanted to try my ability to work in one of the big technology companies.
	So, I'm just a programming fan.
